# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
To help Roza display data from her study in belly button bacteria, a website was created displaying
different charts to show the data. A json file with the subjects data was provided. Using d3 and javascript
the data was parsed and filtered. A drop down menu was created with javascript and html to pick specfiic 
subjects data. That data was then used to populate different charts. These interactive charts were created 
using the Plotly library. The page was then customized using html and css.
